Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository, which contains all the projects I've completed on the Platzi platform. Here, you'll find all the exercises, challenges, and final projects that I've worked on during my time at Platzi.

Each project is located in a separate folder, with the project name as the folder title. Within each folder, you'll find all the project-related files, including source code, configuration files, documentation files, and any other files necessary for the project.

I've also included a README.md file inside each project folder, which describes the project's purpose, necessary requirements for running the project, and any other relevant information that may be helpful in understanding and working with the project.

If you want to clone this repository to your own computer, simply run the following command in your terminal:

bash:
```git clone https://github.com/Dakrfox/Platzi_projects.git```

Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to Platzi for providing me with the opportunity to learn and improve my technical skills through their platform. I hope that these projects will be helpful to you in your own learning journey.

Thank you for visiting my repository! ðŸ˜Š
