# ASYNCHRONISM WITH PLATZI
In this course I learn how to use callbacks, Promise and async/await, some interesting thing as optimization, good practices and in wich situation I need to use them.
## Callbacks 
- Universal (version or Browser)
- Simple
- Callbacks hell ðŸ’€
## Promise
- Ecmascript 6+
- Simple to understand
## Async/Await
- good practice
- clean
- recommended

I use a Rick and Morty API to test all of them and with searching Rick sanchez, dimension: 137 and the total characters.

thanks Platzi for this course/lab.
