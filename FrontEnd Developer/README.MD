# FrontEnd Developer
In this course, the project is something very simple: to use basic HTML and CSS knowledge to create aesthetically well-designed cards.

## Why is this important?

Typically, creating items can be very complicated for beginners in development. It can be difficult to distribute them in a symmetrical manner, to respect standards, and to have the possibility of reusing HTML and CSS code in a readable way. By practicing creating cards with HTML and CSS, students can improve their skills in these areas. Additionally, it is common in the industry to use English as the standard language for coding, so improving proficiency in English can also be beneficial for a career in development.
